I used https://www.screenshotmachine.com/ and its API and Google Drive Api for uploading.
It basically creates "Files" folder inside my project and download & saves the screenshots inside the "Files" folder. After that it uploads the images inside "Files" folder to Google drive!

"localhost" is used for url with xampp.
